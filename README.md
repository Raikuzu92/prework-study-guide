# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This is a website that I have created as a tool to help me learn not only during the boot camp but in my career.

- My motivation is I always love new mental challenges.

- I built this project to help me understand the basics of coding and get more insight into what we will be doing during the class.

- This guide will be helpful in terms of me refreshing my memory or give me peace of mind if imposter syndrome creeps into my head.

Ive gotten a good grip on HTML so far now I want to improve in CSS and Java

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
